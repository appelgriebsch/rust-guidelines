## Unsafe Needs Reason, Should be Avoided (M-UNSAFE) { #M-UNSAFE }

You must have a valid reason to use `unsafe`. The only valid reasons are

1) novel abstractions, e.g., a new smart pointer or allocator,
1) performance, e.g., attempting to call `.get_unchecked()`,
1) FFI and platform calls, e.g., calling into C or the kernel, ...

Unsafe code lowers the guardrails used by the compiler, transferring some of the compiler's responsibilities
to the programmer. Correctness of the resulting code relies primarily on catching all mistakes in code review,
which is error-prone. Mistakes in unsafe code may introduce high-severity security vulnerabilities.

You must not use ad-hoc `unsafe` to

- shorten a performant and safe Rust program, e.g., 'simplify' enum casts via `transmute`,
- bypass `Send` and similar bounds, e.g., by doing `unsafe impl Send ...`,
- bypass lifetime requirements via `transmute` and similar.

Ad-hoc here means `unsafe` embedded in otherwise unrelated code. It is of course permissible to create properly designed, sound abstractions doing these things.

In any case, `unsafe` must follow the guidelines outlined below.

### Novel Abstractions

- [ ] Verify there is no established alternative. If there is, prefer that.
- [ ] Your abstraction must be minimal and testable.
- [ ] It must be hardened and tested against ["adversarial code"](https://cheats.rs/#adversarial-code), esp.
  - If they accept closures they must become invalid (e.g., poisoned) if the closure panics
  - They must assume any safe trait is misbehaving, esp. `Deref`, `Clone` and `Drop`.
- [ ] Any use of `unsafe` must be accompanied by plain-text reasoning outlining its safety
- [ ] It must pass [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri), including adversarial test cases
- [ ] It must follow all other [unsafe code guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/)

### Performance

- [ ] Using `unsafe` for performance reasons should only be done after benchmarking
- [ ] Any use of `unsafe` must be accompanied by plain-text reasoning outlining its safety. This applies to both
  calling `unsafe` methods, as well as providing `_unchecked` ones.
- [ ] The code in question must pass [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri)
- [ ] You must follow the [unsafe code guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/)

### FFI

- [ ] We recommend you use an established interop library to avoid `unsafe` constructs
- [ ] You must follow the [unsafe code guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/)
- [ ] You must document your generated bindings to make it clear which call patterns are permissible

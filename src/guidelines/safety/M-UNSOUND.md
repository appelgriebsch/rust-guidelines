## All Code Must be Sound (M-UNSOUND) { #M-UNSOUND }

<why>To prevent unexpected runtime behavior, leading to potential bugs and incompatibilities.</why>
<guideline-status><active>1.0</active></guideline-status>

Unsound code is seemingly _safe_ code that may produce undefined behavior when called from other safe code, or on its own accord.

> ### <tip></tip> Meaning of 'Safe'
>
> The terms _safe_ and `unsafe` are technical terms in Rust.
>
> A function is _safe_, if its signature does not mark it `unsafe`. That said, _safe_ functions can still be dangerous
> (e.g., `delete_database()`), and `unsafe` ones are, when properly used, usually quite benign (e.g.,`vec.get_unchecked()`).
>
> A function is therefore _unsound_ if it appears _safe_ (i.e., it is not marked `unsafe`), but if _any_ of its calling
> modes would cause undefined behavior. This is to be interpreted in the strictest sense. Even if causing undefined
> behavior is only a 'remote, theoretical possibility' requiring 'weird code', the function is unsound.

```rust
// "Safely" converts types
fn unsound_ref<T>(x: &T) -> &u128 {
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute(x) }
}

// "Clever trick" to work around missing `Send` bounds.
struct AlwaysSend<T>(T);
unsafe impl<T> Send for AlwaysSend<T> {}
unsafe impl<T> Sync for AlwaysSend<T> {}
```

Unsound abstractions are never permissible. If you cannot safely encapsulate something, you must expose `unsafe` functions instead, and document proper behavior.

No Exceptions

While you may break most guidelines if you have a good enough reason, there are no exceptions in this case: unsound code is never acceptable.

> ### <tip></tip> It's the Module Boundaries

> Note that soundness boundaries equal module boundaries! It is perfectly fine, in an otherwise safe abstraction,
> to have safe functions that rely on behavior guaranteed elsewhere **in the same module**.

> struct MyDevice(*const u8);

>     fn new() -> Self {
>        // Properly initializes instance ...
>        # todo!()
>     }
>
>     fn get(&self) -> u8 {
>         // It is perfectly fine to rely on `self.0` being valid, despite this
>         // function in-and-by itself being unable to validate that.
>         unsafe { *self.0 }
>     }

## Don't Leak External Types (M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES) { #M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES }

<why>To prevent accidental breakage and long-term maintenance cost.</why>
<version>0.1</version>

Where possible, you should prefer `std`<sup>1</sup> types in public APIs over types coming from external crates. Exceptions should be carefully considered.

Any type in any public API will become part of that API's contract. Since `std` and constituents are the only crates
shipped by default, and since they come with a permanent stability guarantee, their types are the only ones that come without an interoperability risk.

A crate that exposes another crate's type is said to _leak_ that type.

For maximal long term stability your crate should, theoretically, not leak any types. Practically, some leakage
is unavoidable, sometimes even beneficial. We recommend you follow this heuristic:

- [ ] if you can avoid it, do not leak third-party types
- [ ] if you are part of an umbrella crate,<sup>2</sup> you may freely leak types from sibling crates.
- [ ] behind a relevant feature flag, types may be leaked (e.g., `serde`)
- [ ] without a feature _only_ if they give a _substantial benefit_. Most commonly that is interoperability with significant
      other parts of the Rust ecosystem based around these types.

<sup>1</sup> In rare instances, e.g., high performance libraries used from embedded, you might even want to limit yourself to `core` only.

<sup>2</sup> For example, a `runtime` crate might be the umbrella of `runtime_rt`, `runtime_app` and `runtime_clock` As users are
expected to only interact with the umbrella, siblings may leak each others types.

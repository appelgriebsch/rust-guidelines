## Features are Additive  (M-FEATURES-ADDITIVE) { #M-FEATURES-ADDITIVE }

All library features must be additive, and any combination must work, as long as the feature itself would work on the current platform. This implies:

- [ ] You must not introduce a `no-std` feature, use a `std` feature instead
- [ ] Adding any feature `foo` must not disable or modify any public item
  - Adding enum variants is fine if these enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`
- [ ] Features must not rely on other features to be manually enabled
- [ ] Features must not rely on their parent to skip-enable a feature in one of their children

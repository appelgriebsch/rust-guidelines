## Libraries Work Out of the Box (M-OOBE) { #M-OOBE }

<why>To be easily adoptable by the Rust ecosystem.</why>
<version>1.0</version>

Libraries must _just work_ on all supported platforms, with the exception of libraries that are expressly platform or target specific.

Rust crates often come with dozens of dependencies, applications with 100's. Users expect `cargo build` and `cargo install`
to _just work_. Consider this installation of `bat` that pulls in ~250 dependencies:

```text

Building [==>                       ] 29/251: icu_locid_transform_data, serde, winnow, indexma...
```

This compilation, like practically all other applications and libraries, will _just work_.

While there are tools targeting specific functionality (e.g., a Wayland compositor) or platform crates like
`windows`; unless a crate is _obviously_ platform specific, the expectation is that it will otherwise _just work_.

This means crates must build, ultimately

- [ ] on all [Tier 1 platforms](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html),<sup>1</sup> and
- [ ] without any additional prerequisites beyond `cargo` and `rust`.<sup>2</sup>

<footnotes>

<sup>1</sup> It is ok to not support Tier 1 platforms "for now", but abstractions must be present so support can easily be extended. This is usually
done by introducing an internal `HAL` ([Hardware Abstraction Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_(software))) module with a `dummy` fallback target.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> A default Rust installation will also have `cc` and a linker present.

In particular, non-platform crates must not, by default, require the user to install additional tools, or expect environment variables
to compile. If tools were somehow needed (like the generation of Rust from `.proto` files) these tools should be run as part of the
publishing workflow or earlier, and the resulting artifacts (e.g., `.rs` files) be contained inside the published crate.

If a dependency is known to be platform specific, the parent must use conditional (platform) compilation or opt-in feature gates.

## Don't Glob Re-Export Items (M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS) { #M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS }

<why>To prevent accidentally leaking unintended types.</why>
<version>1.0</version>

Don't `pub use foo::*` from other modules, especially not from other crates. You might accidentally export more than you want,
and globs are hard to review in PRs. Re-export items individually instead:

```rust,ignore
pub use foo::{A, B, C};
```

Glob exports are permissible for technical reasons, like doing platform specific re-exports from a set of HAL (hardware abstraction layer) modules:

```rust,ignore
#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
mod windows { /* ... */ }

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
mod linux { /* ... */ }

// Acceptable use of glob re-exports, this is a common pattern
// and it is clear everything is just forwarded from a single 
// platform.

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
pub use windows::*;

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
pub use linux::*;
```
